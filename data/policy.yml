# SafeNet Policy Configuration
# This file defines your Zero-Trust network topology
# 
# Security Notes:
# - Device names: alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen only (prevents command injection)
# - Default posture: DENY ALL (only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted)
# - Groups: logical groupings for access control rules

# Define network devices/peers
devices:
  # Work devices - trusted endpoints
  - name: worklaptop
    groups: [work, trusted]
  
  - name: workdesktop
    groups: [work, trusted]
  
  # Mobile devices - partially trusted
  - name: phone01
    groups: [mobile, trusted]
  
  # IoT devices - untrusted by default
  - name: smarttv
    groups: [iot, untrusted]
  
  - name: smart_speaker
    groups: [iot, untrusted]

# Define access control rules
access_rules:
  # Allow work devices to communicate with other trusted devices
  - from: work
    to: trusted
    action: allow
  
  # Allow mobile devices to reach work resources
  - from: mobile
    to: work
    action: allow
  
  # DENY IoT devices from reaching work resources (explicit deny)
  - from: iot
    to: work
    action: deny
  
  # DENY IoT devices from reaching mobile devices
  - from: iot
    to: mobile
    action: deny

# Default behavior: If no rule matches, traffic is DENIED (Zero-Trust principle)
